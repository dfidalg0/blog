# Who are you, stranger?

I'm a Full Stack developer with a degree in Computer Engineering from
[*Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica* (ITA)](
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica
), located in Brazil. I like talking about software in general and explore brand
new technologies coming out, trying to squeeze the most out of them. And I like
compilers. And build tools. ~Webpack is ugly though.~

So, I was wondering about writing a blog and thought "why not?". BUT, I din't
want to go the Medium/dev.to path and just write plain blog posts, I kinda wanted
to do something different, *a little coding maybe*, which explains my next point.

# Why are you doing this?

I want to write posts about coding and actually show things working, add some
interactivity to users, if I actually got any. Personally, I don't really care
if someone is really reading it or not, I just want to build something nice
that I can be sort of proud of, a little hobby.

I could use some blog template somewhere in the internet, but what's the fun
about it? I wanted to build it from scratch,
[~starting from the operating system~](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_From_Scratch),
and implement all the things I want included. Of course, I don't wanna implement
the SSR bits or do any systems programming in order to achieve that, it's still
just a freaking blog.

# So, Astro, huh?

I was looking into
[Astro](https://astro.build/)
for some time with some interest. The ability to use many frameworks at once
was definetely a catch to me. See, I want to do a practical display of many
different technologies and Astro gives me a way to easilly do that and even
integrate them (at least for web frameworks), what's not to like about it?

So, I decided to give it a try and the experience was really good. The multi-framework
thing is not the only thing Astro does for you. It can also do SSR and SSG out
of the box without ever being confusing on wheter some code will run on client or
server side (or even at build time), everything shipping JS only when it's necessary.

It alsos encourages devs to reach directly to Web APIs in order to add low bundle
cost interactivity to their websites. And it uses
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/),
so, we have really fast feedback loops.

In order to show some of these things, I built the same component in Vue, Svelte
and React, then I wrapped them into a bunch of Astro components that coordinate
everything. The framework component is simply a counter with an increment and a
decrement button, everything else is just Typescript directly manipulating the
DOM.

<MultiFW />

Notice how those components play nice together and, most importantly, how their
bundles are loaded only when they're visible on the screen (check your Network
tab if you want to be sure), which was achieved by simply adding a
[`client:visible`](https://docs.astro.build/reference/directives-reference/#clientvisible)
directive.

# But not just Astro

Of course one can build an entire application from just Astro, but that's not
the idea here. I want to use every single shiny thing left by the ecosystem.
Then, here I'll list the tools I used and how I used them. Some tools are
inherent to Astro, like Vite, Remark and Rehype, some are choices, like
Highlight.js and TailwindCSS. For all tools that fall into this second category,
I'll try my best to explain why I choose them.

But here's a catch: installing dependencies should be a last resort to achieve
things, since each one of them can pose a security risk and you need to figure
out how to use all of them. So, the only tools listed here are the ones that
provide features I really cannot implement by myself.

Maybe I'm reinventing the wheel sometimes, but I think it's better to tailor
made a wheel that attends all of my needs than buying a full blown automaker
just because I need a simple wheel, which is the case for most `npm` packages.

## pnpm

[pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) is a disk efficient package manager which I didn't have
tried at the time of writing this post and wanted to try it out too and it was
simply wonderful. I needed a few more `pnpm add`'s to get some things to work,
but it's a small price to pay for pnpm's global package store and its strictness
*i.e* if I use an `import` statement, I know it's gonna work since it's on my
[`package.json`](github://package.json).

## TailwindCSS

If you read some source code in the
[section above](#so-astro-huh),
you probably noticed that I'm using
[TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/),
because utility classes make my life better, it was
[incredibly easy](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/astro)
to setup and integrates really well with the light/dark toggle.

Now that we're getting tailwindy, there are different ways we can use it. We
could, for instance, just add a bunch of classes on everything we want to style
(and it's fine), but I prefered to tweak it a little bit, so I went without
`@astrojs/tailwind` base styles

```ts
// astro.config.mjs

import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";

export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [tailwind({ applyBaseStyles: false })],
});
```

then I configured the `background` and `font` colors on
[`tailwind.config.cjs`](github://tailwind.config.cjs) and
added a bunch of styles inside `@layer base` on my
[`main.scss`](github://src/styles/main.scss), which is imported by my base
layout. Then I started to write this very post and feel the need to create
[another file](github://src/styles/md.scss)
with some custom configuration simply for the posts content.

## SCSS

Now, this can feel not ideal for some people and Tailwind even
[discourages the use of preprocessors](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/using-with-preprocessors#using-sass-less-or-stylus), but I really like SCSS for
its nesting and the ability to define build-time variables. I admit this can be
more of a personal taste than anything else, but I think there's no problem with
that since this is just a personal blog.

Maybe I can achieve everything SCSS does with [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/),
which is installed in Vite by default and provides the API used by Tailwind, but
I simply know SCSS more and
[its setup](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors)
was even easier than Tailwind's.

## MDX

Markdown is great for its simple syntax that enables users to focus more on the
content instead of worrying about HTML structure, even though you can use HTML
inside a markdown text. Since I'm writting a blog, which is content heavy by
default, markdown is almost mandatory.

But since we cannot use components inside markdown, writting interactive pages
with it starts to be harder than using Astro components. This is where MDX comes
in - as a superset of Markdown that allows usage of components, we have the best
of both words for authoring our posts. Besides, adding it was really easy, I just
needed to run a simple `pnpm astro add mdx` and I was good to go.

## Highlight.js

This was probably the best part of this implementation. Per the docs,
[Astro comes with two built-in syntax highlighters](https://docs.astro.build/guides/markdown-content/#syntax-highlighting):
[Prism](github:///PrismJS/prism)
and
[Shiki](github:///shikijs/shiki).
It happened that both of them weren't good enough to me for toggling light and
dark mode of the Atom One theme, which is a personal favorite, especially the
dark one.

So, I stumbled uppon
[Highlight.js](github:///highlightjs/highlight.js),
which has a simple and easy API with great customization capability, since it
just uses CSS classes. With SCSS, implementing the dark mode toggler was really
simple:

```scss
@import 'highlight.js/styles/atom-one-light';

:root.dark {
  @import 'highlight.js/styles/atom-one-dark';
}
```

Now, two things are missing:

* Remark's doesn't put the markup generated by highlight.js into the HTML generated
  from markdown code
* Those styles don't apply at all to my code snippets

So, we need to address those, the easy way? Of course not, the hard way, which
is much more interesting and will interact with both Remark's and Vite's plugin
APIs.

### Remark

Astro uses [Remark](github:///remarkjs/remark) under the hood to parse
markdown and generate HTML from that. This tool has a nice plugin API that can
be used to customize HTML generation. So, we can use that to render the markdown
code blocks in an appropriate way, *i.e.* wrapped in `<pre><code class="hljs">`
and with the appropriate `hljs` classes.

We can do that by traversing Remark's AST and replacing the  `code` nodes with
`html` ones containing our `hljs` generated markup.

<CodeFile file="plugins/remark/highlight.ts" />

`getHighlightHtml` implementation is as follows

<CodeFile file="src/utils/highlight.ts" />

After doing this, we can use our Remark plugin on our `astro.config.mjs` by
disabling Astro's default syntax highlighting mechanism and passing our plugin
to `markdown.remarkPlugins`.

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import vue from "@astrojs/vue";
import svelte from "@astrojs/svelte";
import react from "@astrojs/react";
import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";
import { RemarkHighlight } from './plugins/remark/highlight';


export default defineConfig({
  integrations: [vue(), svelte(), react(), tailwind({ applyBaseStyles: false })],
  markdown: {
    syntaxHighlight: false,
    remarkPlugins: [RemarkHighlight]
  },
});
```

### Vite

Remember that SCSS file used for toggling between Atom One light and dark? Now,
we have to import this file everywhere there is any hljs generated code, or else
all the snippets will be uncolored and ugly.

So, there's one perfect valid solution for that, which is importing the `SCSS`
file on the top level of the base Layout component thus adding those styles to
every page on the blog. But, do we really need those styles everywhere? Of course
no, only the pages that have any code snippet written in them have to import that
file.

Fortunately, Astro is built on top of Vite, which has a pretty good
[plugin API](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html)
that extends
[Rollup's](https://rollupjs.org/).
So, we can transform our code to only import the SCSS file from the virtual
modules generated from `.md` and `.mdx` files

<CodeFile file="plugins/vite/md-styles.ts" />

## Vercel

Having everything done, I needed to deploy it somewhere. So I picked
[Vercel](https://vercel.com/) as it's genuinely easy to deploy there and they
have a nice free tier, which is perfect for this tiny little blog. To set it up
I just ran `pnpm astro add vercel` and when I want to deploy, it is just a simple
`vercel deploy`- _pure breeze_.

# Wrapping it up

In this article, I showed you without many details how I get this very blog to
be working. Originally, I was thinking about diving deep into the source code
and explain it piece by piece, but them realized this article would be just
ridiculously enormous and boring. So I decided to summarize the main technological
decisions and dive deep on the source code only for the most important features.
If you wanna see a deep dive into some other parts of the code, let me know
somehow.

Finally, thank you for reading this very first article in this blog, hope that
its content was useful to you in some way or even helped you building your own
application or taking your own tech decisions somewhere.
