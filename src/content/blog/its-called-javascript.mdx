# Introduction

Back in 1994, the concept of Object Oriented Programing got popular, arising
with some
[design patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/catalog),
described in the book
[*Design Patterns*](
  https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/
)
authored by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides. Those
patterns are common ways to solve problems that can be used as guides on how to
structure your OOP code and, consequently, how Java programmers tend to approach
problems.

Speaking of Java, it was released in 1995, just some time after the big OOP boom,
having object orienting
[one of its 5 core principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)#Principles),
which surely speaks a lot about how the language is structured. To this day,
Java is still very popular and relevant, and often referred as the _de facto_
OOP language.

Somewhat inspired by Java's syntax, Javascript was then created on late 1995
trying to embrace its popularity by adopting its name. Later on, JS added OOP
functionalities implemented with prototypal inheritance and, within ES6, added
a `class` syntax similar to Java's. And today, lots of JS code resembles Java
in its concepts and structure without having the type-safety provided by a static
type system, which was improved later by Typescript, that adds a static **type
hinting** system.

But, hear me out, what if it's a bad idea? What if by using common Java structure
you're actually slowing down your code unnecessairily, harming user experience,
and making it more complex, harming developer experience? What would you do?
Refactor everything into procedural code like it's a shell script? That's what
I want to discuss on the next sections of this article.

# The builder pattern

One of the design patterns described by Gamma's book is the builder pattern.
It's useful for building complex objects with lots of parameters. We'll use it
to exemplify a common trend of JS patterns usually being simpler and having less
code.

No more talking, the pattern goes like this:

1. Create a class that represents the object you want to build
2. Create a builder class that holds an instance of the object class and its
creation options.
3. Add a bunch of methods to setup each property of the object class.
4. Add a `build` method to the builder class, that releases a new instance of
the object class with all the options set.

It's usual to return the builder instance after every `setX` method call. This
way we can chain the builder calls in a concise and clean way. After doing that,
everytime we want to instantiate our object class, we instantiate the builder
instead, add what we want and then `build` the thing, like below.

```typescript
function createEmployee(hasITknowledge: boolean) {
  return new EmployeeBuilder()
    .setFirstName('John');
    .setLastName('Doe')
    .setDepartment(hasITknowledge ? 'IT' : 'Management');
    .build();
}
```

In this code, we create a `Employee` instance based on the IT knowledge of a
person. To implement the actual builder, we would do as follows

```typescript
class Employee {
  constructor(
    private firstName: string,
    private lastName: string,
    private department: string
  ) {}

  sayHi() {
    console.log(
      `Hi from ${this.firstName} ${this.lastName} from ${this.department}`
    );
  }
}

export class EmployeeBuilder {
  private firstName?: string;
  private lastName?: string;
  private department?: string;

  setFirstName(name: string) {
    this.firstName = name;
  }

  setLastName(name: string) {
    this.lastName = name;
  }

  setDepartment(dep: string) {
    this.department = dep;
  }

  build() {
    if (!this.firstName || !this.lastName || !this.department) {
      throw new Error('Cannot build employee. Missing data');
    }

    return new Employee(this.firstName, this.lastName, this.department);
  }
}
```

This looks kinda organized and well-structured, but look at how much code we
wrote and how many function calls we're making, builder objects we're creating
just to be garbage collected right after, and complexity we're adding to our
code in order to simply create `Employee` objects.

Now, look the following code. How each of its lines differ from the ones of the
former in terms of intent? *i.e.* the reason the line is there.

```typescript
function createEmployee(hasITknowledge: boolean) {
  return new Employee({
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    department: hasITknowledge ? 'IT' : 'Management',
  });
}
```

Yes, nothing. It's the same code as before, just presented in a different form.
But the implementation actually looks quite different

```typescript
export type EmployeeInfo = Readonly<{
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  department: string;
}>;

export class Employee {
  constructor(
    private info: EmployeeInfo
  ) {}

  sayHi() {
    const { info } = this;

    console.log(
      `Hi from ${info.firstName} ${info.lastName} from ${info.department}`
    );
  }
}
```

That's way less code that get's downloaded, parsed and executed by your client's
machine. Also, the code is dead simple and as performant as it can be, without
calling lots of functions or adding garbage collection.

So, usually, the "options object" is the way to go in JS/TS, it's almost everytime
equivalent to the builder pattern.

## A real world example

Javascript has took somethings straight from Java in the past, the good and
the bad parts (Date API, I'm looking at you), but modern JS now tends to be
more its own thing and developing its own patterns (that can be influences of
other languages, of course). For instance, let's compare the modern native way
of performing http requests in Java and Javascript.

In Java, it tends to use the builder pattern for constructing the request and
client objects, following it by heart. The example bellow show us an example
POST request that creates a user using an API that requires the presence of a
bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```java
import java.net.URI;
import java.net.http.*;

public class MyProgram {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    final String body = "{ \"firstName\": \"John\", \"lastName\": \"Doe\" }";
    final URI uri = new URI("https://some-api.com/users/");

    final HttpRequest req = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
      .uri(uri)
      .method("POST", HttpRequest.BodyPublishers.ofString(body))
      .header("Authorization", "Bearer <token>")
      .build();

    final HttpResponse res = HttpClient.newBuilder()
      .build()
      .send(req, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());

    if (res.statusCode() < 400) {
      System.out.println("User created successfully");
    } else {
      System.err.println("An error occured");
    }
  }
}
```

In Javascript, things tend to be simpler and straight to the point (possibly in
expense of having more control).

```typescript
const res = await fetch('https://some-api.com/users', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: '{ "firstName": "John", "lastName": "Doe" }',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>',
  },
});

if (res.ok) {
  console.log('User created successfully');
} else {
  console.error('An error occured');
}
```

It's possibly like this out of sheer necessity - Javascript **NEEDS** to be small,
otherwise, users will be downloading lots of uneeded code, which degrades
performance and increase page loading times.

This leads us to our next section, which will discuss the impact of common Java
OOP on bundle sizes.

# `class` is not treeshakeable

Modern day Javascript is often bundled by tools like
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/),
[Parcel](https://parceljs.org/),
[Esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/)
or, my personal favorite,
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
Those tools benefit from ESM `import/export` syntax to keep on JS final bundle
exactly what needs to be there. For instance, if an external library has code
like this

```typescript
// node_modules/some-lib/index.js

export function doSomething() {
  // some cheap utility function
}

export function doAnotherThing() {
  // expensive function with lots of dependencies and millions of lines of code
  // that can literally build the entire universe from scratch
}
```

and you have a `import { doSomething } from 'some-lib'` statement, your bundler
will (probably) be smart enough to know `doAnotherThing` can be skiped by the
bundling process, and the final bundle that your client or serverless runner
will read, parse and execute is left as smallest as possible.

Now, supose it was implemented as a Singleton, for example,

```typescript
export class ThingDoer {
  private constructor() {}

  private static instance?: ThingDoer;

  static getInstance() {
    return ThingDoer.instance ??= new ThingDoer();
  }

  doSomething() { /* ... */ }
  doAnotherThing() { /* ... */ }
}
```

Now, your bundle will contain both `doSomething` and `doAnotherThing` without
the latter ever being used.

This was a problem to Google's
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
on their web SDK. So, Firebase web SDK went modular on v9. With that change,
Firebase was able to reduce its footprint on JS bundles by
[up to 80%](https://firebase.blog/posts/2021/07/introducing-the-new-firebase-js-sdk).

The same aproach Firebase used on their product can help you improve the bundle
size of your own application. For instance, supose you are building a social
network and you have a `User` class like this

```typescript
export interface UserInfo {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

export class User {
  constructor(private id?: string, private info?: UserInfo) {}

  getId(): string {
    return this.id ??= generateRandomId();
  }

  async create() {}

  async getInfo(): Promise<UserInfo> {}

  async updateInfo(patch: Partial<UserInfo>) {}

  async getFriends(): Promise<User[]> {}

  async addFriends(ids: string[]) {}

  async removeFriend(friendId: string) {}
}
```

Now, supose you're on the user's profile page, where they can view their own
info, their friends and other stuff. You basically need only two of those
functions to display this page: `getInfo` and `getFriends`. Some features could
be lazy loaded like the `removeFriend` and `updateInfo` that are very unlikely
to be used when the user enters his profile and some features like `create`
aren't used at all.

But, still, you load everything.

Of course you can split this into multiple classes, but where is **the** place
to do the split? It's simply easier to ditch the `class` altogether and use ESM
in your favor.

```typescript
export async function createUser(id: string, info: UserInfo) {}

export async function getUserInfo(userId: string): Promise<UserInfo> {}

export async function updateUserInfo(userId: string, patch: Partial<UserInfo>) {}

export async function getUserFriends(userId: string): Promise<User[]> {}

export async function addFriendsToUser(userId: string, friendIds: string[]) {}

export async function removeFriendFromUser(userId: string, friendId: string) {}
```

With this, you can import only what you need and let your bundler do its job
optimizing your JS so your users don't have to download 6 functions when only
2 are actually needed. You can also dynamically import `removeFriend` and
`updateInfo` only when the user actually performs said action or, if you prefer,
you can load them in the background while the profile page is loading.

Also, if you're using a a method lots of times and don't want to keep passing
down the same parameter over and over again, you can `.bind` the method's first
parameter

```ts
const addFriends = addFriendsToUser.bind(null, 'some-user-id');
```

Although removing classes may help improving bundle size, there are some problems
that come with it, mainly when you're used to write object oriented code. In the
next section, I'll discuss some of those drawbacks and how to handle them.

# Handling private state

Private state is a pretty common thing in OOP and Javascript has it natively via
`#` class fields. But now that I'm saying classes should be avoided, how can we
manage private state?

Well, let's break it down into two cases: singletons and non-singletons.

## Singletons

Singletons are a common pattern (or anti-pattern as some might say) that goes
like this:

* There's only a single source that can give you an object
* This source gives you the same object every time you request it

In Java, it's usually implemented like this

```java
public class Singleton {
  private static Singleton instance;

  public static Singleton getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) instance = new Singleton();

    return instance;
  }

  private Singleton() {
    myState = 'some-value';
  }

  private String myState;
}
```

which translates directly to Typescript as

```ts
export default class Singleton {
  private static instance?: Singleton;

  public static getInstance() {
    return this.instance ??= new Singleton();
  }

  private constructor() {}

  private myState = 'some-value';
}
```

But, hey, you don't need to memorize this pattern apply it just like it was
popularized in Java. If you stick to the concept, you'll realize Javascript's
module system is precisely managing singletons for you. See? You can request
a module by its id and you'll always receive the same instance every single time.

So, think of your very JS/TS module as a singleton and you'll see that dealing
with private state is simply declaring a non-exported variable.

So, let's say, for example, we're building a [slither.io](https://slither.io/)-like
game where you just go there, choose a nickname and are able to play. Your
current user can be managed as a singleton like this

```ts
let nickname: string | undefined;

export function setUserNickname(newNickname: string) {
  if (!newNickname) {
    throw new Error('Nickname must not be empty');
  }

  nickname = newNickname;
}

export function getUserNickanme() {
  if (!nickname) {
    throw new Error('User does not have a nickname');
  }

  return nickname;
}
```

You can also do lazy initialization by requiring the singleton instance to be
passed as a parameter to your functions. In this example, we're creating a
connection to a key-value remote store like [Redis](https://redis.io). In this,
we can get only a single connection to the store and then use it to set or
retrieve a key with a private variable used as a local cache.

```ts
async function createConnection(): Promise<Connection> {
  // establishes a connection with the storage
}

let connPromise: Promise<Connection> | undefined;

export async function getConnection() {
  return connPromise ??= createConnection();
}

export async function setKey(conn: Connection, key: string, value: string) {
  // ...
}

const cache: Record<string, Promise<string>> = {};

async function doGetKey(conn: Connection, key: string): Promise<string> {
  // ...
}

export async function getKey(conn: Connection, key: string) {
  return cache[key] ??= doGetKey(conn, key);
}

export function getSomeSyncInfo(conn: Connection) {
  // returns some information available to the connection synchronously
}
```

You can also remove the need to pass `conn` to every function by calling
`getConnection` from the exported methods. But doing so, you now have a coloring
problem - every function must be async.

```ts
// ...

export async function setKey(key: string, value: string) {
  // Every function must get the connection before actually do its own thing
  const conn = await getConnection();
  // ...
}

// ...

export async function getSomeSyncInfo() {
  const conn = await getConnection();
  // now, everything down here is synchronous, but you need to get the
  // connection before and now you need to make this function async
}
```

You can also go with async initialization but then get the asynchronously
created `conn` synchronously, which can be convenient, but lets you shoot
yourself in the foot.

```ts
// ...

let connPromise: Promise<Connection> | null = null;
let cachedConnection: Connection | undefined;

export async function initConnection() {
  if (cachedConnection) return;

  await connPromise ??= createConnection()
    .then((conn) => {
      cachedConnection = conn;
      connPromise = null; // the promise can be garbage collected now
    });
}

// Now, getConnection is synchronous
function getConnection() {
  if (!cachedConnection) {
    throw new Error('Connection not established');
  }

  return cachedConnection;
}

export function getSomeSyncInfo() {
  // our function now can be synchronous, but now it can throw an error
  const conn = getConnection();
  // our sync logic keeps being sync
}
```

This way, you are responsible for initializing the connection before doing
anything, otherwise you'll get an error thrown at your face. This is a coomon
approach in some database engines for Node.js.

It's also important to state that all that's described here would be precisely
the same thing using a singleton class, but without treeshakability. So, for
singletons, there's absolutely no reason to write a class instead of just using
pure ESM besides stylistic choices. This is because, as stated before, ES modules
ARE singletons by design, there's no need to reinvent it.

But in OO, it's pretty common to have multiple instances of an object, not just
a simple singleton. What if we need private state in those scenarios?

## Non-singletons

Enough of singletons - now, we're talking about everything else. How can we model
objects that have private state without using classes? In OO, functions inside
an object are the only ones that can access properties that live inside the same
object.

```ts
class Rect {
  #area: number;
  #width: number;
  #height: number;

  constructor(width: number, height: number) {
    this.#width = width;
    this.#height = height;
    this.#updateArea();
  }

  #updateArea() { this.#area = this.#width * this.#height; }

  get width() { return this.#width; }
  get height() { return this.#height; }
  get area() { return this.#area; }
  set width(w: number) { this.#width = w; this.#updateArea() }
  set height(h: number) { this.#height = h; this.#updateArea() }
}
```

We can mimic this behaviour using ES6 `Symbol`s if we wish

```ts
const privateSym = Symbol('private-properties');

type Rect = ReturnType<typeof createRect>;

export function createRect(width: number, height: number) {
  return {
    // ... public
    [privateSym]: {
      // private
      width,
      height,
      area: width * height,
    }
  };
}

function updateArea(rect: Rect) {
  const priv = rect[privateSym];
  priv.area = priv.height * priv.width;
}

export function getWidth(rect: Rect) { return rect[privateSym].width; }
export function getHeight(rect: Rect) { return rect[privateSym].height; }
export function getArea(rect: Rect) { return rect[privateSym].area; }
export function setWidth(rect: Rect, w: number) {
  rect[privateSym].width = w;
  updateArea(rect);
}
export function setHeight(rect: Rect, h: number) {
  rect[privateSym].height = h;
  updateArea(rect);
}
```

Turns out this is creating properties that aren't really private, since
`privateSym` can be obtained by a `Object.getOwnPropertySymbols` call. Although
this can be enough in some cases, we're pursuing the ideal way.

So, what if we take the private state away from the object by delegating them
to a module level private state manager like the following?

<StateManagerArch />
<span class="text-xs">Diagram made with [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com)</span>

Well, turns out we can! Since we know how to declare private state in a singleton
ESM, we can declare this said state manager. For best performance and memory
usage, we can use a
[`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap)
as it won't hold the object private properties after the object is garbage
collected. This will make our code look like this

```ts
const state = new WeakMap<Rect, State>();

declare const __isRect: unique symbol;

interface Rect {
  [__isRect]: true;
}

interface State {
  width: number;
  height: number;
}

export function createRect(width: number, height: number) {
  const rect = {} as Rect;
  state.set(rect, { width, height, area: width * height });
  return rect;
}

// public static method
export const createSquare = (size: number) => createRect(size, size);

// private method
function updateArea(rect: Rect) {
  const priv = state.get(rect)!;
  priv.area = priv.height * priv.width;
}

// public methods
export function getWidth(rect: Rect) { return state.get(rect)!.width; }
export function getHeight(rect: Rect) { return state.get(rect)!.height; }
export function getArea(rect: Rect) { return state.get(rect)!.area; }
export function setWidth(rect: Rect, w: number) {
  state.get(rect)!.width = w;
  updateArea(rect);
}
export function setHeight(rect: Rect, h: number) {
  state.get(rect)!.height = h;
  updateArea(rect);
}
```

In this code, we declared an inexistent symbol (`__isRect`) that won't ever be
used, but will make Typescript complain when you try to pass anything else than
a rect to any of the functions, making this ES Module behave almost identically
to a `class`. If you want to know more about this, you can look for "branded
types".

Of course this example is convolute to a certain extent since it's just a simple
rect object and the `class` code is much shorter. In a case like this one, you
probably should prefer using a `class` directly, but when you have a really
big object like Firebase did, splitting the code like this can improve bundle
sizes dramatically, improving user experience as well.

We can generalize this idea by implementing the actual state manager we draw
earlier like this:

```ts
// state-manager.ts

declare const __priv: unique symbol;

type State = Record<string, unknown>;
type Instance<Pub, Priv> = Pub & { [__priv]: Priv };
type MethodContext<P, S> = { self: Instance<P, S>; priv: S };
type Builder<Args extends unknown[], Pub extends State, Priv extends State> =
  (...args: Args) => ({ pub: Pub, priv: Priv });

export function createStateManager<
  Args extends unknown[] = [],
  Pub extends State = Record<string, never>,
  Priv extends State = Record<string, never>
>(builder: Builder<Args, Pub, Priv>) {
  const stateMap = new WeakMap<Instance<Pub, Priv>, Priv>();

  /*@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__*/
  function build(...args: Args) {
    const state = builder(...args);
    const instance = (state.pub ?? {}) as Instance<Pub, Priv>;
    stateMap.set(instance, state.priv ?? {} as Priv);
    return instance;
  }

  /*@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__*/
  function fn<Args extends unknown[], Ret>(
    impl: (ctx: MethodContext<Pub, Priv>, ...args: Args) => Ret
  ) {
    return (self: Instance<Pub, Priv>, ...args: Args) => {
      const ctx = Object.defineProperties(
        { self } as MethodContext<Pub, Priv>,
        { priv: { get: stateMap.get.bind(stateMap, self) } }
      );

      return impl(ctx, ...args);
    }
  }

  return { build, fn };
}
```

The `@__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__` comments tell your bundler the `build` and `fn`
functions have no side effects, which means it can remove calls to them if the
return value is not actually used.

It seems lengthy at first, but most of this code is actually just Typescript
generics manipulation that will be removed. So, the whole thing minified will
be just 258 bytes in the end.

Finally, our `Rect` example will look like this:

```ts
// rect.ts

import { createStateManager } from './state-manager';

const Rect = createStateManager(
  (width: number, height: number) => ({
    priv: { width, height, area: width * height}
  })
);

export const createRect = Rect.build;

export const createSquare = (size: number) => createRect(size, size);

// We can define our methods with `fn` calls. Those methods will receive the
// instance's public and private state, but the actual interface will expect
// the Rect instance as the first parameter
const updateArea = Rect.fn(({ priv }) => priv.area = priv.width * priv.height);

export const getWidth = Rect.fn(({ priv }) => priv.width);
export const getHeight = Rect.fn(({ priv }) => priv.height);
export const getArea = Rect.fn(({ priv }) => priv.area);

export const setHeight = Rect.fn(({ self, priv }, height: number) => {
  priv.height = height;
  updateArea(self);
});

export const setWidth = Rect.fn(({ self, priv }, width: number) => {
  priv.width = width;
  updateArea(self);
});
```

And now, every function a module wants to use from the `Rect` object must be
imported by it, in a way that bundlers like Rollup can remove the entire
implementation of unused functions in a bundle. This simple example won't do
much, in fact it would be better off just using classes, but in a larger module,
which is quite usual, it would make a real difference.

So, now that we know how to implement main `class` functionalities without using
actual classes, having discussed the drawbacks of such implementation, we can
now wrap everything up in the next (and last) section.

# Final Thoughts

If you reach all the way through here, congratulations, you're a fighter. In this
section I'll try to sumarize the whole thing and discuss about what I said here.

In this article, I talked about design patterns common to OOP that have very
specific implementations in Java and how those patterns can harm your JS code
if implemented as they are, since they can make lots of code go to your final
bundle without ever being used.

Even though, throughout the article, I did mention several times you should
avoid using classes, there are cases when they are simply better than any
alternative I presented here, it's up to you to find those cases. Personally,
I think they're somewhat rare since everything are functional components, plain
objects and singleton services these days.

Dependency injections, for instance, can be handled by a singleton service that
manages every injection you have in your application like Vue's `provide`/`inject`
API, thus not requiring you to implement an entire OOP logic to implement this
kind of thing. The strategy pattern, which is one of the most common ways of
implementing DI, is commonly reduced to plain callbacks.

And Just like the builder, singleton and strategy patterns, every single OOP
pattern can be implemented in JS in a bundle efficient way with API interfaces that
uses only primitives, functions and plain objects. In modern JS, things are meant
to be straight to the point and "on demand", which is quite the opposite of Java
and its verbose ways.

You can embrace this and keep your bundle sizes minimal and your code simpler
but still implement useful design patterns common to OOP. All you need to do
is stick to the pattern concept instead of trying to implement it the way it is
in Java. With that knowledge, you can get the most out of any programming
language out there keeping your code well structured anywhere you write it.
